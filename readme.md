[Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/discover): to download routes as .gpx files, see the [Komoot](#komoot) section.    
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/segments/explore): the best way to find cycling routes in Strava is to open a segment in the desired location and open the profiles of some athletes, viewing their activities. To download activities as .gpx files, use the [Strava GPX downloader Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strava-gpx-downloader/pnglhfabfkchkadgnkfacoakincdpeeg).


## Hiking

### Hiking routes
[Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/discover): to download routes as .gpx files, see the [Komoot](#komoot) section.  
[AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore): requires login to download routes as .gpx.  
[Outdooractive](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/routes/): requires login to download routes as .gpx.  
[Hiking Buddies](https://www.hiking-buddies.com/routes/routes_list/): does not require a login to download routes as .gpx.

# Apps

## Organic Maps

### Description
Fork of Maps.me, is a simple and intuitive app for accessing the OpenStreetMap (OSM) map base offline. In some countries, OSM is better than Google Maps and HERE WeGo (e.g. the Morocco's medinas were not mapped in Google Maps/HERE WeGo maps base). It also allows to easily find Sight amenities (e.g. all Plitvice Lakes view points).


## OsmAnd
([Website](https://osmand.net) | [GitHub](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.plus) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id934850257))

### Description  
Excellent app for cycling and hiking. Features include import and display .gpx routes, overlay specific POIs (e.g. Drinking Water).
